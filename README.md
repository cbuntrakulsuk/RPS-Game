### What I learned

In my third React.js project, I embarked on a journey with TypeScript for the first time, and it enriched my understanding of several crucial aspects of web development.

### Continued development

I am enthusiastic about taking on the bonus sections to expand the game to include Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock, as well as implementing a persistent scoreboard state that survives browser refreshes. These enhancements are poised to elevate the excitement and educational value of this already exhilarating gaming experience.
